# My Server
I like to mess around with servers. This repository is for storing all setups for my servers. Due to security issues, I will not be sharing some confidential information. 

## :warning: Disclaimer
Please do not try to break into my server. I know there are lots of vulnerabilities in this, but this is for just demonstration purpose only.

## :book: Index

## :link: Live Services
